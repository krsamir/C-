# C# | Identifiers
***
In programming languages, identifiers are used for identification purposes. Or in other words, `identifiers` are the `user-defined name` of the program components. In C#, an identifier can be a `class name`, `method name`, `variable name` or `label`.

>public class demo {<br>
>    static public void Main () <br>
>    {<br>
>          int x;<br>
>    }<br>
>}<br>
Here the total number of identifers present in the above example is 3 and the names of these identifiers are:

* demo: Name of the class
* Main: Method name
* x: Variable name

## Rules for defining identifiers in C#:
### There are certain valid rules for defining a valid C# identifier. These rules should be followed, otherwise, we will get a compile-time error.
* The only allowed characters for identifiers are all `alphanumeric characters`([`A-Z`], [`a-z`], [`0-9`]),`‘_‘ (underscore)`. For example “word@” is not a valid C# identifier as it contain ‘@’ – special character.
* Identifiers should **not** `start with digits`([`0-9`]). For example “123demo” is a not a valid in C# identifier.
* Identifiers should **not** contain `white spaces`.
* Identifiers are **not** allowed to use `as` keyword unless they include `@` as a `prefix`. For example, @as is a valid identifier, but “as” is not because it is a keyword. 
* C# identifers allow `Unicode Characters`.
* C# identifiers are `case-sensitive`.
* C# identifers cannot contain more than `512 characters`.
* Identifiers does not contain `two consecutive underscores` in its name because such types of identifiers are `used for the implementation`.
